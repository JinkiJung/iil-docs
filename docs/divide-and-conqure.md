# Divide and conquer

*iil* doesn't apply different modeling both tasks and subtasks. *iil* defines `goal` to make reference from a child *iil* (or subtask) to a parent *iil* (or task).

Using *iil*, which can represent both high-level and low-level tasks with the same model, users can easily break down their work into smaller units in the planning phase and monitor the progress from the same perspective.

Furthermore, during the execution phase, users can easily follow up on what purpose the current task is being performed for.
