# Intro

*iil* is a work description model for human. 
The goal of iil is to render all levels (from high- to unit-level) of work in a single representation.
It's similar to playing with Lego blocks that can be easily assembled and customized.

The importance of *iil* is to state responsibility and where or how a work should be started or finished. Also it is possible to represent the relationship between iils such as consequence or super/subtask. *iil* can help people understand tasks through a clear and concise representation of work which can be used to effectively communicate about work across all levels of an organization.

*iil* has a life cycle and following status.

* NOTACTIVATED: The IIL model has not yet been activated. It is essentially dormant and not being used.

* ACTIVE: Once the IIL model has been activated, it enters the active state. This means that the actor of this model is now being actively acting.

* FINISHED: When a task or goal has been completed successfully, the IIL model enters the finished state. This means that the task or goal has been achieved, and no further action is required.

* PENDING: If there are any tasks or goals that are awaiting further action, the IIL model enters the pending state. This means that those tasks or goals are on hold until certain conditions are met.

After completion of an *iil* you can make conditional flows which in turn render consequences

*iil* applies event-driven nature.

## Show case

iil-based todo list service will be opened to testify its capability.
