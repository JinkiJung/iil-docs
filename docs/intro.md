# Introduction

*iil* is a work description model for human. 
The goal of iil is to render all levels (from high- to unit-level) of work in a single representation.
It's similar to playing with Lego blocks that can be easily assembled and customized.

The importance of *iil* is to state responsibility and where or how a work should be started or finished. Also it is possible to represent the relationship between iils such as consequence or super/subtask. *iil* can help people understand tasks through a clear and concise representation of work which can be used to effectively communicate about work across all levels of an organization.

*iil* applies event-driven nature.
