# State

*iil* has a life cycle and following status.

* NOTACTIVATED: The IIL model has not yet been activated. It is essentially dormant and not being used.

* ACTIVATED: Once the IIL model has been activated, it enters the active state. This means that the actor of this model is now being actively acting.

* FINISHED: When a task or goal has been completed successfully, the IIL model enters the finished state. This means that the task or goal has been achieved, and no further action is required.

* PENDING: If there are any tasks or goals that are awaiting further action, the IIL model enters the pending state. This means that those tasks or goals are on hold until certain conditions are met.

* ABORTED: The state indicates that the work has been cancelled during its execution, before reaching a successful or failed conclusion.

After completion of an *iil* you can make conditional flows which in turn render consequences
